To start we needed to find out how we need to build our solution in the MapReduce setting.
We know we need to have a AND/OR construction to get the desired S curve effect.
Therefore we applied the technique from the lecture where we banded the matrix. 
The condition that a combination of two movies is a candidate for a near duplicate is
that it matches for a hash table across at least one band. Therefore it makes sense
that we emit the band id together with the hash table as a key.
The reducer then gets per band all movies in a list that are candidate pairs, and must
only check them pairwise and emit the ones that truly have a estimated Jaccard similarity of
0.85 and more.

Find parameters:

Plot function and find out for which r and b we have f(0.85) close to 0.5
We want to include false positives and exclude false negatives since then "only" have more work
First we had 15 and 10 (f(0.854) = 0.5), but then we increased b such that we have FN = 0

After trying to plot and tune to find the optimal parameters we tried finding them programmatically
to yield the parameters that have zero(1-(1-x^r_and)^b_or - 0.5) as close as possible to 0.85
by trying a lot of different combinations that match the criteria
We got 0.8499 for r_and = 25 and b_or = 40 -> this takes really long to compute
Therefore we found the top 10 best estimations and tried one with smaller params

So that was not successful, everything takes waaaay too long.
Therefore we should limit the number of hash functions by a smaller number.
It seems that after exceeding 300 the computation takes too long
Therefore we tried the best estimate under 300 hash functions:

Important is that we have FP=50 and FN=0, this tells us we have not missed any duplicate just because we chose params wrong

So the next step is to find out how much we can increase the number of hash functions, without taking too long to compute.

!!!! test this again !!!!

Ok these are very bad, lets try to widen the scope a bit. After widening the search space to 300-1024 we still got the same results as above.
From that we that we get the best results if we use under 300 hash functions

So now we have our best estimate using 19 and 14 for our parameters, there is still a discrepancy between the local performance and the one
on the server. But without looking at the leaderboard this is our best solution on the local test set, therefore this solution should be
the one that performs best in terms of generalization.
